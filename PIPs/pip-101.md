## Simple Summary

[Megaclite](https://patractlabs.github.io/megaclite) is a zero-knowledge proof tool set building for the Polkadot ecology. Patract requires `0x01000000-0x010000ff` for ZKP `fid`s.  Currently, Megaclite provides `add`, `mul`, `paring` three type atomic functions (same as EVM precompiled contracts), and every type atomic function has 4 type ZKP cryptographies. Thus Megaclite needs 3x4=12 `fid` to provide ZKP support.

## Abstract

Compared with the privacy function, the performance improvement brought by Rollup is the early application direction of zero-knowledge proof. At present, the Layer 2 expansion plan of the blockchain is to transfer a considerable part of the on-chain workload to off-chain to complete, and the most watched one is ZK Rollup. This proposal needs to claim 12 positions in `0x01000000-0x010000ff`

## Motivation

The Ethereum Layer 2 protocols related to ZK Rollup are: [zkSync](https://zksync.io/), [aztec](https://aztec.network/), etc. Their contract verification modules share a part of the elliptic curve's basic algorithms. In 2017, Ethereum integrated three basic cryptographic calculation units of the alt bn128 curve in the form of pre-compiled contracts, which are [EIP196](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-196.md)’s ADD and Scalar_MUL algorithms, and [EIP197](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-197.md)’s Pairing algorithm. On top of this, due to the lack of rapid upgrade capabilities of Ethereum, the community can only encapsulate some tool libraries through costly Solidity contracts. On top of these basic contract libraries, many DApps can combine ZK Rollup technology to achieve some innovations, such as [loopring](https://loopring.org/), [gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/) and [uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) etc. However, in the past 3 years, ZK technology has further developed, such as the more practical [BLS curve](https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-snark-curve/), and [PLONK algorithm](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/953/20190827:165656) etc. Ethereum has not yet supported it.

In Megaclite, Patract Labs provides 4 type ZKP cryptographies:

// TODO

And every cryptography provides `add`, `mul`, `pairing`.

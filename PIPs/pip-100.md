| 100  | Function id for `pallet-contracts` ChainExtension | Aten Jin (@atenjin) | Standards Track | Core     | DRAFT  | 2020-12-17 |

## Simple Summary

Function id(aka `fid`) is same as precompiled contracts concept in Ethereum EVM, thus, we need to specification to assign the `fid` for different features.

This proposal is a summary of all assigned `fid`. Specific `fid` would be discuss in different PIP proposals.

## Abstract

This Pip suggests to agree on a specification for the function id (aka `fid`) in `pallet-contracts` ChainExtension. In this Pip, we will assign `fid` field for all possible situation.

## Motivation

`pallet-contracts` module could be integrated easily in any substrate based blockchain. However, if the `pallet-contracts` module wants to interact other runtime modules in this chain, developers need to implement the `ChainExtension` for `pallet-contracts`. In `ChainExtension`, the way to call different functions or modules need to provider a function id (`fid`) to distinguish them, thus, the `fid` is same as precompiled contracts in Ethereum EVM.

On the other hand, developers would implement different libraries to provider different features, and when they establish their codes, they need to point a `fid` as the bridge between `ink!` and `pallet-contracts`. In a general way, developers would package `seal_call_chain_extension` (in `ink!`) with `fid` in their libraries for contracts, and provide the `match` code block with `fid` in their implementations for Substrate runtime. Thus, if we do not allocate the `fid` field before, different developers may assign conflicted `fid` for different libraries. For users, if want to use tow libraries from different developers which contains conflicted `fid`, they need to fork this libraries and change this `fid`.

Thus, we need to divide `fid` in to different group, to reserve enough field `fid` for all possible case, and developers could follow this specification to establish their codes and assign their `fid`.

## Specification

In `pallet-contracts`'s `ChainExtension`, `fid` is an `u32` parameter, it's 4 bytes, thus we have the scope from `0x00-0xffffffff`. 

Meanwhile, in EVM, precompiled contracts is a tow bytes address, thus for precompiled contracts, it's scope is `0x00-0xffff`. For compatibility in future, we advice to reserve this 2 bytes for EVM precompiled contracts scope.

For now, we advice the following convention:

| Main-definition                                      | Scope(from-to)        | Sub-definition                    | Sub-Scope             | Commands                                                     |
